**`Digital Crafsman`**

Hi there! I'm a tech enthusiast with a deep love for Linux servers and the intricacies of running services on them. My journey in technology began with web development, where I honed my skills in WordPress and freelanced as a web developer. Along the way, I mastered HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript, but my true passion lies in Python.
